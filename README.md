## 🪰 Housefly Sim Project

**Housefly Sim** is a lightweight, modular platform for designing, visualizing, and simulating the behavior of small multirotor drones.
It provides the foundational tools needed to model drone physics, explore flight dynamics, and test how a drone reacts to different inputs, environmental factors, and configuration changes.
